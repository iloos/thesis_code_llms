\textbf{Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What methodology can be employed to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of different coding LLMs in Python code generation?
    \item How do different coding LLMs perform when evaluated against common benchmarks and performance metrics?
\end{enumerate}
