\textbf{Overarching Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do different large language models (LLMs) compare in their ability to generate Python code, and what factors contribute to their performance variability?
    \item What are the implications of coding LLMs for the future of software development practices, and how can potential risks be mitigated while maximizing their benefits?
\end{enumerate}
