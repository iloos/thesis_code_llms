\textbf{Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What are the strengths and weaknesses of different coding LLMs in generating Python code, and how do they vary based on model architecture and training data?
    \item What factors contribute to the performance variability observed in coding LLMs, and how can these factors be mitigated or leveraged to improve overall performance?
\end{enumerate}
