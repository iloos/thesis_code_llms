\textbf{Research Questions:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of LLMs, and how effective are they in capturing the nuances of language and code generation?
    \item What are the limitations of existing evaluation metrics, and how can a more comprehensive evaluation framework be developed to address these limitations?
\end{enumerate}
