This thesis explores the field of large language models, or LLMs, and how they can generate Python code. Natural language processing (NLP) has been transformed by LLMs. However, beyond natural language, LLMs have shown great potential for generating code. This thesis explores the capabilities of LLMs for Python code generation, aiming to inform researchers and software developers.
